# Energy_Consumption-Time_Series_Forecasting_Study
Time Series Forecasting Study based on [Hourly Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption) datatabse from Kaggle.

**PJME Time Series EDA & XGBoost** ([Github](https://github.com/diegokurashima/Energy_Consumption-Time_Series_Forecasting_Study/blob/main/PJME_Time_Series_EDA_%26_XGBoost.ipynb), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/diegokurashima/pjme-energy-time-series-eda-xgboost)) notebook contains EDA Study and Forecasting Moddeling with XGBoost for Energy Consumption from PJM East Region (PJME). I studied Trends, Seasonality and Cyclicity to train a Regressor for the Next Year Consumption.

**PJME ARIMA, SARIMA & SARIMAX** ([Github](https://github.com/diegokurashima/Energy_Consumption-Time_Series_Forecasting_Study/blob/main/PJME_ARIMA%2C_SARIMA_%26_SARIMAX.ipynb), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/diegokurashima/pjme-arima-sarima-sarimax)) contains my study on ARMA based models ARIMA, SARIMA and SARIMAX for Energy Consumption from PJM East Region (PJME).
